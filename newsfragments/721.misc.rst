For postgresql tests use the ability of pytest-postgresql to create database
and fill in it's contents once per full test runs.

This ought to speed up the full test suite as instead of creating database
and filling up with test data each test it'll be done only once,
and each tests postgresql will clone the template database with data
into a test database.
